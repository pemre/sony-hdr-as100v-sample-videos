# ðŸ“¹ Sony HDR-AS100V sample videos and photos

I had a broken video recorded by Sony HDR-AS100V. One of the files in its sd card was somehow corrupted. So I wanted to try out [mp4fixer](https://github.com/pemre/mp4fixer) tool. But I needed a working copy. By the time I needed to fix it, I already lost my original files and the device (I've borrowed it). My original files were uploaded to Google Photos so they were re-encoded.

Long story short, I found many samples that Matt created and shared in Techmoan blog. Just in case the original pCloud file goes down, I wanted to store these video and photo files in GitHub.
